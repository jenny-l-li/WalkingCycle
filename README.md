# WalkingCycle
Mathematica demonstration of walking cycle (in 2D animation) using both key frames and mathematics

First file WalkingCyclePt1 illustrates animation as done traditionally by illustrating each key frame, then compares this process to a walking cycle animated using mathematics to translate the walking figure along a sine curve. 

Second file WalkingCyclePt2 includes interactive figure with customizable graphics and gait that walks in sync to the beat of a selected song.
